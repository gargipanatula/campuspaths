created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph
added node E to simpleGraph
added node F to simpleGraph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from A to D in simpleGraph
added edge 2.000 from B to C in simpleGraph
added edge 2.000 from D to E in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from C to F in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from E to F in simpleGraph

path from A to F:
A to B with weight 1.000
B to C with weight 2.000
C to F with weight 1.000
total cost: 4.000
